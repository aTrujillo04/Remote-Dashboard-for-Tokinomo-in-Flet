**#Dashborad design programmed in FLet framework to control a Tokinomo and its features.**
###The following project consists in a designed Dashboard programmed with Flet. The dashboard contains a login section in which is neccesary to authenticate your licenses to access the following section. The next section contains 5 different buttons, each of them to control differente features (ilumination, sounds or dc motor) other button initialize the complete routine, just if the movement PIR sensor detects a person. And the final button consists in a slide button to control the spin motor speed by conotroling the PWM signals.

###Besides, the components works by a Raspberry pi 5, so the Dashboard must have remote communication with the Raspberry in order to control their pinout. In this way, a Flask Server was programmed in the Raspberry, so the dashboard 
must send remote HTTP requests by POST method wich consists in sending packaged data that requests converts to JSON format. This is the ideal way to send state changes such as the ones in the buttons (on/off). Finally the Flask server decode the packaged data and execute the pinout programmed logic to set to high or low a GPIO or control a PWM signal, according to the data that is received from the dashboard button state,
